# QUB-Challenge-Programming-to-an-interface
1) Create an interface IMyShape.java to represent a shape.  The interface should include the method signatures

               double calculatePerimeter();

               double calculateArea();

               String getShapeName();
               
2) Develop three classes, each of which implements the IMyShape interface.  The classes should represent a circle, square and rectangle respectively.  Choose appropriate instance variables for each class and initialise these in the constructor of each.

3) Create a class to for an ad hoc test of the implementations. 

In the main method of the class randomly generate ten shapes (a mixture of circles, squares and rectangles) and store them in an array or arraylist.

4) Also in the main method, write a loop that displays the name, area and perimeter of each shape in the array / arraylist.
